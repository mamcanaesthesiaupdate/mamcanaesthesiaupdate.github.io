          Welcome to the 5th MAMC Anaesthesia Update! The Department of Anaesthesia, MAMC, is excited to host this event
          from
          October 15th to October 19th, 2024. This program has become a key platform for postgraduate students across
          the
          country,
          fostering learning, discussion, and innovation.
        </p>

        <p>
          This year's update features a diverse range of topics designed to aid postgraduate students preparing for
          their MD,
          DNB,
          and DA exams, as well as practicing anaesthesiologists. Our sessions, led by distinguished faculty, will
          include live
          case discussions, didactic sessions, interactive workshops, OSCE, music therapy, and recent advances in
          anaesthesia.

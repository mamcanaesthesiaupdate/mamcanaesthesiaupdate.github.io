It is a pleasure for the Department of Anaesthesia, MAMC  to welcome you for its 3rd MAMC Anaesthesia Update. We are holding this event between 1st February to 5th february 2022. This program has been popular among postgraduate students from all over our country. Our initial endeavor was to organize it in the offline mode. However, with the recent sudden surge in COVID cases and the subsequent government guidelines for the same, it will now be conducted **ONLINE**.

Our effort will be to provide quality preparation for postgraduate students appearing for MD, DNB &DA examination. Various topics in anaesthesia will be covered by eminent faculty through didactics, live case discussions, demonstrations of commonly asked equipments in viva voce with emphasis on practical knowledge and recent advances. This academic event will be an enriching experience.
We look forward to your participation at the 'MAMC ANAESTHESIA UPDATE 2022'.

It is a pleasure for Department of Anaesthesia MAMC to welcome you for its 3rd MAMC Anaesthesia Update 2022 after a year gap due to the pandemic, this programme had been popular among postgraduate student all over country. Next year we plan to hold this event on 1st February to 5th February 2022. 

Our belief is that online webinar cannot replace personal interaction of physical event, which discouraged us to hold this mega event during pandemic, hence department of anaesthesia will hold the conference in person. 
In case of surge of COVID we might have to restrict physical presence and hold it online mode, also full refund will be made if COVID forces cancellation of event.

Our effort will be to provide quality prepration for postgraduate students appearing for MD, DNB & DA. Various topics in anaesthesia will be covered through Didactics, live case discussions, table demonstrations by eminent faculty from teaching institute across the country with emphasis on practical knowledge and recent advances in anaesthesia. Surely the course will be unforgettable congress filled with academic event.

We look forward to meet you at MAMC ANAESTHESIA UPDATE 2022 keep logging in for new updates.
